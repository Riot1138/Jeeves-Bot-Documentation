# Class

The Class integration assigns roles based on the classes of the characters a player has.
## Use case

This integration could be used to show which class a player is on your server. It is recommended that this integration have the Character scope set to Main Only.
## Default roles

By default you will need to create roles in the following format for this integration to work. Jeeves now has a command to create the roles for you as well as give it the accompanying class colors. `/role-tools class generate-default-roles`.
```
Death Knight
Demon Hunter
Druid
Hunter
Mage
Monk
Paladin
Priest
Rogue
Shaman
Warlock
Warrior
```

## Custom Rolemap

This integration allows for the setup of custom roles, rather than the roles detailed above. To use this feature you will need set a role for each class.
