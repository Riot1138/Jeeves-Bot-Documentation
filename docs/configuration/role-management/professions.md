# Professions

The Professions integration assigns roles based on the primary professions the characters of a player has.

## Use case

This integration could be used to show which players have a profession levelled. This could then be used in chat for people to ask a message to certain roles and pinging the players who have that profession.
## Default roles

By default you will need to create roles in the following format for this integration to work. You can now use Jeeves to make these roles for you. `/role-tools professions genearte-default-roles`.
```
Alchemy
Blacksmithing
Cooking
Enchanting
Engineering
Fishing
Herbalism
Inscription
Jewelcrafting
Leatherworking
Mining
Skinning
Tailoring
```
## Custom Rolemap

This integration allows for the setup of custom roles, rather than the roles detailed above. To use this feature you will need set custom roles names to each profession.
