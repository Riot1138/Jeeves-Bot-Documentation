# Command Control

You can use Discord's Integration Menu in your server to restrict the bot as a whole and even specific commands to users/roles/channels of your choice. Jeeves does havea legacy support to do this via the website Dashboard but it is considered depreciation and will be removed in the future. Please use Discord's Integrations page to setup your command restrictions. To do this navigate to your Discord Server Settings and find `Integrations` listed under `Apps` on the left. At the bottom of that menu, you will find your bots, clicking on `Manage` will bring you to the command controls.

You can restrict Members and Roles who can use the slash commands by clicking `Add Roles or Members`. The default should be all. You can also restrict to channels. To restrict certain commands to channels/roles, simply select or search the command you wish to restrict and click the command. You can then specify Role/Member/Channel for the command who can or can't use it.
