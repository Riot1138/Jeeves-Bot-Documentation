# SyncRanks Command

Quickly sync your warcraft ranks to discord via the Guild Sync integration. See the guild guide for more info on setting this up

**Note:** Warcraft only updates the Guild API once ever 3 hours, as such Jeeves attempts to automatically sync every 3 hours. Running this command does not affect the 3-hour update on warcraft's side but will run your update early.

**Developer Thoughts**
>There have been a many times were I promote someone ingame and forget to promote someone in discord as well. The same can be said for a person who joins the guild, but joins discord a few hours, or even days later. Let Jeeves worry about giving them ranks, Guild Managment is hard enough.
