# SyncRanks Command

Quickly sync your Warcraft ranks to discord via the Guild Sync integration. See the guild guide for more info on setting this up


### Details

**Aliases:** `guildsync`    
**Available in DM:** No   
**Can Restrict to a channel:** Yes

**Note:** Warcraft only updates the Guild API once ever 3 hours, as such Jeeves attempts to automatically sync every 3 hours. Running this command does not affect the 3-hour update on Warcraft's side but will run your update early.

### Examples

* `!guildsync`
> Trigger an instant re-syncing

**Developer Thoughts**
>There have been a many times were I promote someone in game and forget to promote someone in discord as well. The same can be said for a person who joins the guild, but joins discord a few hours, or even days later. Let Jeeves worry about giving them ranks, Guild Management is hard enough.
