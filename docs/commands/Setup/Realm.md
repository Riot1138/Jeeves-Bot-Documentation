Tell Jeeves what realm you play on!

***
### Details
**Aliases:** `bot-realm` | `setup-realm` | `botrealm` |`setuprealm`   
**Available in DM:** No   
**Can Restrict to a channel:** Yes

* This allows Jeeves to make assumptions for things so you don't have to specify realm in certain commands
* Jeeves will also start using your realms timezone when talking about times and dates.
You can change this with [timezone](/commands/setup/timezone)
* You can only setup a single realm as your default realm.
If you play on a cross-realm server its highly advised you set your main realm as the realm your guild was created on.

* `!setup realm mal'ganis`
>Tells Jeeves your guild plays on mal'ganis
* `!setup realm bleeding hollow`
>Tells Jeeves your guild plays on bleeding hollow
