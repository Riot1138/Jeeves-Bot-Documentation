# Keystone Command

Love to share your keystone(s) with your guild members? You can add your keystone(s) to your characters. This command works together with the `!character` command.



### About

**Aliases:** `keystone`   
**Available in DM:** No   
**Can Restrict to a channel:** Yes

* With multiple active high-level characters you can use `!keystone <character> <dungeon> <level>`. With this, you can easily track keystones within your guild.

* By adding your characters to Jeeves, it is easier to keep track of which character has which keystone. You'll also see the item level of the characters!
