# Character Command

This is Jeeves internal character management tool. It serves 4 main functions
* View YOUR characters
* View another users characters
* Mark certain characters as your *Main* or *Hidden*
* Request an update for your characters

**Hidden Characters:** You can have as many of these as you want. Jeeves will essentially ignore they exist for all commands

**Main Character:** Only 1 character can be your main. When running a command involving a character like the keystone command Jeeves will assume your main character if none are mentioned
