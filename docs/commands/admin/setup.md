# Setup command

The setup command is the main command used when first setting up Jeeves.

This command has two modes: **Guided** and **Targeted**.

Guided setup is triggered by simply running `!setup`, which provides a prompt-based introduction and explanation of the most basic settings.  
`!setup` is recommended for all first-time fresh installs of Jeeves.

The targeted setup allows you to quickly change a given setting. For example, if you wished to change the prefix that Jeeves responds to you could target that setting with `!setup prefix`.

You can further choose to either run `!setup prefix` in which you will be shown a brief intro and explanation of that setting and then prompted to change/clear it, OR you can run `!setup prefix ?` to directly change the prefix without the prompts.

Below are a list of available setup settings:

`!setup` - Enter Guided Setup  
`!setup prefix` - Prefix Configuration  
`!setup realm` - Realm Configuration  
`!setup audio-mode` - Audio Mode Configuration  
`!setup bot-channel` - Bot Channel Configuration  
`!setup audio-channel` - Music Channel Configuration  
`!setup greeting` - Welcome message configuration  
`!setup RoleManager` - Automatic Role Management Options + custom roles  
`!setup role-channel` - Reaction based role channel configuration
